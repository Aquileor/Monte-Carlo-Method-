##Monte Carol Questions


#1. Why do we multiply the value from step 5 above by 4? 

We multiply the value from step 5 by 4 because the circle is broken down into 4 separate quadrants and we are focused on the first quadrant. In order to actual get the answer to get close to PI we have to multiple our quadrant (1) by the total number of quadrants (4) to get an actual and accurate answer.

#2. What do you observe in the output when running your program with parameters of increasing size?

I observe that as the parameter grow in size the output starts to get closer and more accurate to true π(PI).

#3. If you run the program multiple times with the same parameter, does the output remain the same? Why or why not?

No it does not because this code is truly random. Every time the code is ran the point will never start off the same. If this was the case then this program would not truly be random.

#4. Find a parameter that requires multiple seconds of run time. What is that parameter? How accurate is the estimated value of π.

The parameter that requires multiple seconds of run time is 100,000,000. The output was 3.14155996 which is one of the closest so far to actual Pi which is 3.14159265358979.
The actual difference between the two is 3.29693589 * 10^5

#5. Research one other use of Monte-Carlo methods. Record it in your exercise submission and be prepared to discuss it in class.

So while I was doing more research finding other things or topics that use the Monte-Carlos I came across a paragraph on Wikipedia that really interested me. It actually involves the Coast Guard and how they use the Monte Carlo methods within its computer modeling software SAROPS in order to calculate the probable locations of vessels during search and rescue operations.

By using the Monte-Carlos methods the Coast Guard can produce a simulation can generate as many as ten thousand data points that are randomly distributed based upon provided variables.

Based off of those variables search patterns are then generated based upon extrapolations of the data in order to optimize the probability of containment and the probability of detection, which then will equal an overall probability of success. 

I found it so interesting because at the end of the day this allows for the best, efficient and fastest way to find a missing person or vessel put in the Ocean.
